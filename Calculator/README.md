## 📌 Program Overview

The program allows the user to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation to perform on them.  
Based on the user’s choice, the calculator performs the selected operation and displays the result.

The calculator supports addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and an option to exit.
