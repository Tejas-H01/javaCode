# Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Beginner Friendly Guide & Practice Programs

This folder contains Java programs that demonstrate the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in a simple and easy-to-understand way.  
It is designed so that even someone **new to Java and OOP** can read this folder, understand the ideas, and then see how those ideas are written in code.

## 📌 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming is a way of writing programs by thinking in terms of **real-world objects**.

Instead of only writing logic and functions, we:
- Create **classes** (blueprints)
- Create **objects** (real instances of those blueprints)
- Group **data** and **behavior** together

Example:
- A **Car** has data → brand, year  
- A **Car** has behavior → move(), stop()

OOP helps us write programs that are:
- Easier to understand
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to extend

## 📌 Program Overview

The programs in this folder explain the **four main pillars of OOP** in Java:

1. **Encapsulation**
2. **Inheritance**
3. **Abstraction**
4. **Polymorphism**

Each concept is explained using **real-world examples** like:
- Bank accounts
- Employees and managers
- Vehicles
- Animals
- Payment systems

This makes the concepts easier to relate to and understand.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Explained (Beginner Friendly)

### 🔒 Encapsulation (Data Protection)

Encapsulation means **hiding internal data** and allowing access only through controlled methods.

In simple words:
> “Don’t allow anyone to directly change important data.”

Example:
- Bank balance should not be directly modified
- It should be accessed using **getter** methods
- Modified only through **specific actions** like deposit

Why it is important:
- Prevents accidental data corruption
- Improves security
- Makes code safer and cleaner

---

### 🧬 Inheritance (Reuse Existing Code)

Inheritance means **one class uses another class’s properties and methods**.

In simple words:
> “A child class can reuse what the parent class already has.”

Example:
- `Employee` → basic salary
- `Manager` → salary + bonus
- `Car` and `Bike` → both are vehicles

Why it is important:
- Avoids duplicate code
- Makes programs easier to extend
- Models real-world relationships

---

### 🎭 Abstraction (Hide Implementation Details)

Abstraction means **showing only what is necessary** and hiding how things work internally.

In simple words:
> “User knows *what* happens, not *how* it happens.”

Example:
- You click **Pay**
- You don’t care whether it’s UPI, Card, or Net Banking
- Each payment method has its own internal logic

Why it is important:
- Reduces complexity
- Makes programs flexible
- Allows changing implementation without affecting users

---

### 🔄 Polymorphism (Same Action, Different Behavior)

Polymorphism means **the same method behaves differently** depending on the object.

In simple words:
> “Same command, different result.”

Example:
- `calculateRentalCost()`  
  - For Car → higher cost  
  - For Bike → lower cost  
  - For Truck → different logic  

Why it is important:
- Makes code scalable
- Reduces conditional logic
- Enables runtime decision-making

## 🧪 What These Programs Demonstrate

Across this folder, the programs show:

- How classes and objects work
- How methods are overridden
- How parent class references point to child objects
- How `super` keyword works
- How Java decides which method to call at runtime
- How real-world problems can be modeled using OOP

All examples are kept **simple, readable, and beginner-safe**.

---

## 🖥️ Outputs

Each program produces console output showing how the OOP concept works in practice.  
Screenshots of outputs (`output.png`, `output1.png`, `output2.png`) are included inside individual program folders for reference.

---

## 📂 File Information

The `OOP_codes` folder is divided into subfolders based on OOP concepts.  
Each subfolder contains:
- Java source files
- Output screenshots
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining that specific example
