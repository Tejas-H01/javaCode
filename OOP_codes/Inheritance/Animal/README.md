# Java Inheritance – Animal, Dog, and Cat Example Program

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates the concept of **inheritance** and **method overriding** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using an animal-based example.  
It is intended for beginners who are learning inheritance, method overriding, and basic class hierarchies in Java.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program models a simple **animal hierarchy** where a base class `animal` defines common properties and behaviors.  
Two child classes, `dog` and `cat`, inherit from the base class and override specific behaviors to provide their own implementations.

The program demonstrates how different objects respond differently to the same method calls.

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Defines a base class `animal` with:
  - A private name field
  - Getter and setter methods
  - Common behaviors such as `eat()` and `sayHello()`
- Defines child classes `dog` and `cat` that:
  - Extend the `animal` class
  - Override the `sayHello()` method with animal-specific behavior
- Demonstrates inheritance and method overriding through object creation.
- Shows how the same method behaves differently based on the object type.
