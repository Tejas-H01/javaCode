# Java Inheritance – Employee Salary Example Program

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates the concept of **inheritance** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using an employee salary example.  
It is intended for beginners who are learning inheritance, method usage, and object relationships in Java.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program models a simple **employee-management system** where a `Manager` class inherits properties from an `Employee` class.  
It demonstrates how a child class can reuse and extend the functionality of a parent class.

The program also shows how a parent class reference can point to a child class object.

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Defines a base class `Employee` with:
  - Employee name
  - Basic salary
  - A method to calculate salary
- Defines a derived class `Manager` that:
  - Inherits from `Employee`
  - Adds a bonus component
  - Uses `super` to access the parent class method
- Demonstrates inheritance using object creation.
- Prints the calculated salary to the console.
