# Java Increment and Decrement Operators – Example Program

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the behavior of **increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators** in Java.  
It is intended for beginners who are learning how pre and post operations work in Java expressions.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program demonstrates the use of:

- Post-increment (`a++`)
- Pre-increment (`++a`)
- Post-decrement (`a--`)
- Pre-decrement (`--a`)

It also includes mixed expressions to show how Java evaluates expressions involving increment and decrement operators.

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Demonstrates the difference between **post** and **pre** increment.
- Demonstrates the difference between **post** and **pre** decrement.
- Shows how variable values change during expression evaluation.
- Uses mixed expressions such as `b++ + b` and `++c + --c` to explain order of execution.
- Prints intermediate and final values using `System.out.println()`.
