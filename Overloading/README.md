# Java Method Overloading – Practice Programs

This folder contains multiple Java programs that demonstrate the concept of **method overloading** using different real-world and logical examples.  
It is intended for beginners who are learning how Java supports multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The programs in this folder showcase method overloading through various use cases, such as:

- Result evaluation based on different numbers of subjects
- Login validation with and without OTP
- Calculating sums using variable arguments
- Area calculation for different shapes

Each program highlights how Java resolves method calls based on **number, type, or structure of parameters**.

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Demonstrates method overloading using:
  - Different parameter counts
  - Variable arguments (`varargs`)
- Uses practical examples instead of abstract methods.
- Applies conditional logic and arithmetic operations.
- Shows how overloading improves code readability and reuse.
- Keeps implementations simple and beginner-friendly.

## 🖥️ Output

Each program generates console output based on user input or predefined values.  
The output for individual programs is documented within their respective folders using screenshots (`output.png`).
