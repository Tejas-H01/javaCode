# Array Analysis and Number Reversal

This program demonstrates basic array analysis and numeric manipulation using core Java constructs.  
It is intended for beginners revising loops, conditionals, and arithmetic logic.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program performs two independent tasks within a single execution.  
First, it counts positive and negative numbers in an integer array.  
Second, it reverses a given integer using mathematical operations.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- One-dimensional arrays
- `for` loop iteration
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Integer counters
- While loop
- Modulus and division operators
- Digit extraction and number manipulation

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- An integer array is initialized with mixed positive and negative values.
- Two counters track the count of positive (including zero) and negative numbers.
- A `for` loop iterates through the array and updates counters based on conditions.
- The counts of positive and negative numbers are printed to the console.
- An integer number is initialized for reversal.
- A `while` loop extracts digits using the modulus operator.
- The reversed number is constructed using multiplication and addition.
- The final reversed number is displayed as output.
