# Java Bitwise Operators – Example Program

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the usage of **bitwise operators** in Java and how they operate at the binary level.  
It is intended for beginners who are learning Java fundamentals and low-level operations.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program demonstrates the use of the following bitwise operators:

- Bitwise AND (`&`)
- Bitwise OR (`|`)
- Bitwise XOR (`^`)
- Bitwise NOT (`~`)

It also shows how integers are represented in **binary format** using Java’s built-in methods.

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Declares integer variables and displays their binary representation.
- Performs bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations.
- Prints both the **decimal result** and the **binary equivalent** of each operation.
- Uses `Integer.toBinaryString()` to visualize bit-level changes.
- Helps understand how bitwise operators manipulate individual bits.
