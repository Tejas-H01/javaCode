# Arithmetic Operators in Java

## 📌 Overview
This program demonstrates the use of **arithmetic operators in Java** using `double` data types.  
It covers basic arithmetic operations, operator precedence, and compound assignment operators.

The goal of this program is to understand how arithmetic expressions are evaluated in Java, especially when multiple operators are involved.

---

## 🧮 Operators Demonstrated
The following arithmetic operators are used in this program:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Compound assignment operators:
  - `+=`
  - `-=`
  - `*=`

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts Explained
- Use of `double` data type for decimal calculations
- Left-to-right evaluation when operators have the same precedence
- Effect of operator precedence in arithmetic expressions
- How compound operators modify the original variable value

Example concept:
- In expressions involving `*` and `/`, Java evaluates them from **left to right** when precedence is the same.
